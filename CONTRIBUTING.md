## Conventional Commits

A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages. The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your application/library:

 1. **fix**: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in semantic versioning).
 1. **feat**: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in semantic versioning).
 1. **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in semantic versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
 1. **types other than fix: and feat:** are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
 1. **footers other than BREAKING CHANGE**: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

Example of conventional commit:

```
docs: add description of conventional commits to CONTRIBUTING.md file
```
