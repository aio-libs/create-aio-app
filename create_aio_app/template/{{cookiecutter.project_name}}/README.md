### Database
Management of database (postgres) migrations takes place with the help of [alembic](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/).

Create new migration (new file in `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/migrations/versions/`):

```
make migrations # the command must be running after `make run` 
```

Apply migrations:

```
make migrate # the command must be running after `make run` 
```

If u wanna create new file with tables u should import tables to `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}/migrations/env.py`

```
import {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}.users.tables # import new files here
```

If u need to make downgrade or other special things with alembic, use `make bash`
for penetration inside the container and run native alembic's commands.

```
make bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

To connect to postgres, use the command below

```
make psql # the command must be running after `make run` 
```
